  <p>The Office is a tv show about a dysfunctional paper company called Dunder Mifflin. The boss, Michael Scott, jokes around and barely does any work. There are many employees that can barely stand him. The employees take advantage of having a bad boss and Jim constantly pranks another worker named Dwight. Jim's pranks, the workplace drama, and having Michael Scott as their boss, makes The Office such a great and funny show.</p>
